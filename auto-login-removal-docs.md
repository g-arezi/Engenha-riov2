# Auto-login Removal Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to disable the auto-login functionality in the Engenha Rio system, allowing for manual testing of the login process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Auto_login.php Files
- **Root auto_login.php**: Commented out all functionality
- **public/auto_login.php**: Modified to redirect to login page
- **public/auto_login_web.php**: Modified to redirect to login page

### 2. Router Configuration
- Modified `public/router.php` to bypass the problematic index.php inclusion
- Implemented a custom routing solution that doesn't rely on auto_login.php
- Added all necessary routes from the original index.php to maintain functionality

### 3. Public/index.php
- Removed direct references to auto_login.php
- Modified session handling to prevent auto-login
- Created a completely clean version without any auto-login dependency

### 4. Testing
- Created a test page (`test-auto-login.php`) to verify auto-login is disabled
- Confirmed login redirects work correctly
- Verified that session handling is working properly

## Verification
To verify that auto-login has been disabled:
1. Visit http://localhost:8000/test-auto-login.php
2. Check that "No user is logged in" is displayed
3. Try to access protected pages (should redirect to login)
4. Login manually through the login form
5. Access protected pages after login (should work)

## Technical Notes
- The main issue was that index.php had a hard-coded require statement for auto_login.php
- The solution was to bypass index.php and implement our own routing through router.php
- This approach maintains all functionality while disabling the auto-login feature

## Usage
The system now requires manual login. Use the following credentials:
- Email: admin@engenhario.com
- Password: password
